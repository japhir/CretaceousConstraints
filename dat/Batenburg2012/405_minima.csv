,0,,minimum,Cycles 1-3 are lighter and thinner than the underlying cycles. This is consistent with the identification of a 405-kyr minimum at the K/Pg-boundary by Kuiper et al. (*).
,2,12,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these three bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed."
well-defined,16,,minimum,"The marl of cycle 21, and to a lesser extent the marl of cycle 22, is lighter and thinner than the surrounding marls and form a protruding point of the cliff."
,17,28,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these three bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed."
,32,,minimum,"The marl of cycle 41 is poorly developed and the limestone of cycle 42 is very prominent, forming a slightly protruding point."
,38,44,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these two bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed. Just below 41m, the beds are hard to distinguish, coinciding with a probable ~100-kyr minimum."
,47,,minimum,The individual cycles are very thin and the more resistant part of the cycle is very poorly expressed.
,49,59,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these three bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed."
well-defined,61,,minimum,"The individual beds are thinner and poorly expressed, especially the marlyer beds. "
,65,72,maximum ,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these two bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed. At 68m there is a double limestone bed with no marl in between, coinciding with a probable ~100-kyr-minimum."
,76,,minimum,"The marl of cycle 94, and to a lesser extent the marl of cycles 93 and 95, is very thin and light compared to the surrounding marls and this level forms the furthest protruding point."
,80,89,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these three bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed compared to bundles above. At 82m, there is a very thin limestone and a very thin marl, probably coinciding with a probable ~100-kyr minimum."
,91,,minimum,"The marly and less marly layers are hard to distinguish at this level, the marls are not so dark and the less marly layers are very thin and not very resistant."
,96,108,maximum,"The marls, grouped in bundles of five, are darkest and thickest in the middle of these two bundles, and these bundles are most clearly expressed."
,111,,minimum,"The cycles are thin and difficult to identify, because the marls are very poorly expressed, and all beds are very carbonaceous"
,114,119,maximum,The individual cycles are easier to identify and the marls around 116 are very prominent.
,122,,minimum,"The cycles are thin and difficult to identify here, because the marls are very poorly expressed, and all beds are very carbonaceous."
,126,132,maximum,"The cycles are very regular and easy to distinguish, with a very prominent marl at 128m."
well-defined,135,,minimum,"The marl of cycle 173 is very thin, and the limestones of cycle 173 and 174 very prominent, forming a protruding point into sea."
,137,143,maximum,"The cycles are very clear and grouped in groups of five, with the darkest marls in these two bundles."
