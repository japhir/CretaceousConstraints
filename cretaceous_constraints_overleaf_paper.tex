% this is a first draft!
%Problem
Astronomical solutions form the backbone of accurate dating for geology and paleoclimate studies.
Beyond \appr\qty{50}{\millionyearago}, however, the chaos inherent in the solar system makes it impossible to calculate a single unique astronomical solution.
Geological data have been used to constrain this chaos in order to arrive at a geologic time scale up to the end-Cretaceous.
%Action
Here, we adopt and extend this approach into the latest Cretaceous, by re-analyzing the Zumaia and Sopelana composite proxy records from the Maastrichtian.
%Results
We find that the filtered \gls{L*} record is most compatible with the astronomical solution ZB20a.
However, these results are sensitive to parameter choices in our algorithm, which we describe in detail.
Nevertheless, \acrlongpl{VLN} in the astronomical solutions that coincide with large amplitudes in the short eccentricity-related peaks in the filtered proxy record give a clear indication on why the ZB20a solution should be favored when performing cyclostratigraphy for the latest Cretaceous.
% decided to not focus on the \gls{KT} age for now.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

% Astronomical solutions have improved dating, form the backbone of cyclostratigraphy,

% but CHAOS

% constrain the chaos with geologic data

\ijk{I've focused on the figures, methods, results, and discussion first. In that order.}

%% I like how some of RZ's paper's start with an ancient quote
%% ``Cool quote that addresses how crucial good dating is''.
%% Maybe something from \citeA{Berger1980} review? Or perhaps \citeA{Berger1989}.

As we move to older and older time-periods, the available records will get further distorted and \ijk{TODO}.

\ijk{@REZ: I just added \cite{Westerhold2017} here. They make the comparison between data and several solutions and comment on implications, but it's not so explicit.}

In this work, we use geological data to constrain astronomical solutions that most accurately reflect Earth's orbit in order to ultimately provide an astronomical time scale for applications in geology and paleoclimate.
For previous on the Paleocene and Eocene, see \citeA{Westerhold2017,ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
The Walvis Ridge records used in these studies are exceptional in their quality, so finding comparable records that capture precession-scale alternations and patterns of amplitude modulation for older time periods is difficult at this time.

Here we use the best available records immediately prior to the \gls{KT} (informal use)
for the Maastrichtian (data falls between \qtyrange{71.1}{65.9}{\millionyearago}).
We use the Zumaia and Sopelana terrestrial composite records, as generated by \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

\ijk{Something to introduce long eccentricity (\qty{405}{\kiloyear} period) and short eccentricity (\appr\qty{100}{\kiloyear} period). Do we need abbreviations for the two? Like \(e_{l}\) and \(e_{s}\) or SEC and LEC?}

\ijk{TODO:\ write out this section on using 405 kyr for tuning}
\ijk{I think this should go in the introduction if I want to talk about it?}
% while stable, the long ecc cycle does differ somewhat between solutions
Many studies have suggested that because the long eccentricity cycle is stable in the geologic past, we can rely on it for tuning records older than \appr\qty{40}{\millionyearago}~\cite<i.e.>{Westerhold2010,Dinares-Turell2013}.
However, recent developments in astronomical solutions indicate that while this is true, the phasing of this \qty{405}{\kiloyear} cycle does shift when we go further back in time.
% taner filter \qty{\frac{1}{405}}{\per\kiloyear} \pm 25%
% calculated this myself
For example, at the long eccentricity minimum between \ma{13} and \ma{14}, the age of the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minimum already differs by up to \qty{85.2}{\kiloyear} between different astronomical solutions (largest difference between La10c and ZB20a).
The long eccentricity minimum near \qty{65.9}{\millionyearago} differs by up to \qty{70}{\kiloyear} between solutions (largest difference between La11 and ZB20a, second-largest difference between La10c and ZB20a of \qty{34}{\kiloyear} if we exclude La11).
This means that providing absolute ages of Maastrichtian records based on tuning to the long eccentricity cycle of any particular astronomical solution without first constraining the chaos in this interval with geological records, may underestimate the true uncertainty.
The implications for this when comparing absolute astronomical ages to Ar/Ar and Ur/Pb ages \ijk{TODO}.


One of the key differentiating factors between different astronomical solutions is the timing of \acrshortpl{VLN}.
When the individual components that make up the short eccentricity cycle (i.e., \appr\qtylist{95;99.7;124;132.5}{\kiloyear}) \rez{should be ca. 95,99,124,131}\ijk{see email} interfere to cancel each other out, only the long eccentricity component (\appr\qty{405}{\kiloyear}) remains clearly visible.

\subsection{Datasets Used}\label{sec:data}

In order to find the most suitable Maastrichtian proxy record that best reflects amplitude variations in long- and short eccentricity,
we have considered several coastal sections of marine successions and sea floor drill core sites.
Proxy records from the following sites and studies were considered:
Gubbio~\cite{Voigt2012,Sinnesael2016},
ODP Leg 208 Site 1267~\cite{Westerhold2007,Westerhold2008,Husson2011},
IODP Leg 342 Site U1403~\cite{Batenburg2018},
Zumaia and Sopelana~\cite{tenKateSprenger1993,Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014,Dinares-Turell2013},
ODP Leg 198 Site 1210B~\cite{Jung2012,Kim2022},
ODP Leg 74 Site 525A and ODP Leg 207 Site 1258A~\citeA{Husson2011},
and ODP Leg 122 Site 762C~\citeA{Husson2011,Thibault2012}.
For the present study, we selected the Zumaia and Sopelana I field sections,
which show the clearest orbitally-forced patterns for the Maastrichtian~\cite{tenKateSprenger1993,Batenburg2012,Dinares-Turell2013},
and continuous high-resolution proxy records~\cite{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

The coastal cliffs of Zumaia and Sopelana are located in the Bay of Biscay in the Basque Country, Northern Spain~\cite{Herm1965,Pujalte1993}.
%\ijk{NOTE: I tried to go through the literature trail thoroughly to arrive at the first study on this site, but most of these older papers are very hard to access!}
and comprise quasi-periodic alternations between limestones and marls, interbedded with turbidites~\cite{tenKateSprenger1993,Pujalte1999}. % this is cited as Pujalte 1998 in Batenburg2012, year off-by-one!
\citeA{Dinares-Turell2013} concluded that these successions could play ``a primary role as a geologic aid for critical developments of the astronomical solutions''.
% does the below add anything? unfortunately the quote is also quoted on wikipedia...
The Zumaia section is one of the first 100 geological heritage sites, which was described as ``One of the best exposed, most continuous and highly studied outcrops of deep marine sediments in the world'' \cite[pp.~71--72]{Hilario2022}.
See \citeA{Batenburg2014} and references therein for some historical context of the study sites. % this has better refs than their 2012 paper I think.
% quote from Batenburg2014: (Herm 1965; Percival & Fischer 1977; Lamolda 1990; Ward et al. 1991; Ten Kate & Sprenger 1993; Ward & Kennedy, 1993; elorza & García-Garmilla 1998; Pujalte et al. 1998; Dinarès-Turell et al. 2003, 2013; Gómez-Alday et al. 2008; Kuiper et al. 2008) and a reference section for the K–Pg boundary (Molina et al. 2009).
% they also say ten Kate & Sprenger 1993 first cyclostrat paper of the site.

Care must be taken when considering the lower Maastrichtian at the Zumaia site due to frequent turbidite successions,
while the upper Maastrichtian was tectonically more stable~\cite{Pujalte1998}.
\rez{[let's make sure the following text is not too close to
the original refs]}
\ijk{I've looked at the original refs again. It was obviously never copy-pasted, but looking at it again it \emph{was} mostly reshuffled text. I am not sure how close I can be to the original text that I cite/if I need to incorporate other stuff...}
The upper Maastrichtian section of Zumaia also contains many thin turbidites,
whose occurrence shows many random spectral peaks, but may also include an eccentricity and obliquity signal for cycles \ma{1--4}~\cite<the first four long eccentricity bundles prior to the \gls{KT},>{tenKateSprenger1993}. % this part is not mentioned in Batenburg
However, the pattern of limestone--marl alternations in the Zumaia succession that has been associated with astronomical forcing remained undisturbed by the turbidites in the upper Maastrichtian~\cite{Batenburg2012}.
The Sopelana section covers the lower part of the Maastrichtian, and has a similar lithology but without indications for turbidites, likely because it was located farther offshore~\cite{Batenburg2012}.
The proxy record from Zumaia~\cite{Batenburg2012} was extended to include Sopelana in \citeA{Batenburg2014}.

% this is basically a summary of Batenburg2012 table 1
The alternations in color and bed resistance that occurred at periods of \appr\qty{70}{\cm} were logged in detail~\cite{Batenburg2012,Dinares-Turell2013}
and have been associated with climatic precession forcing (\appr\qtyrange{19}{23}{\kiloyear}).
Bundles of 5 of these couplets with darker, redder, thicker beds---especially in the marls---were related to short eccentricity amplitude modulation (\appr\qty{4}{\metre}, \appr\qty{100}{\kiloyear}),
which in turn were grouped in 4 bundles that were associated with the long eccentricity cycle (\appr\qty{16}{\metre}, \appr\qty{405}{\kiloyear}) and expressed as limited thinner marlier parts~\cite{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.
% TODO: I don't like the wording in the above
Eccentricity modulates the amplitude of climatic precession,
with eccentricity maxima and strong precession minima linked to enhanced seasonal contrast in the Northern hemisphere.
This is thought to intensify the hydrological cycle in the region, resulting in the deposition of thicker, darker marls~\cite{Batenburg2014}.
% I'm citing Batenburg2012 and Batenburg2014 A LOT, maybe we need a simple acronym for them? B12 and B14?

\citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014} measured the \gls{MS}, the \gls{d13C}, and the \gls{L*} of rock samples (among others), but we focus on \gls{L*} in the main manuscript.
The \gls{d13C} proxy showed clear long eccentricity-related cycles but the short eccentricity was less clearly expressed,
which follows from carbon isotopes being more sensitive to lower frequencies in orbital forcing due to its long residence time~\cite{Zeebe2017,Kocken2019loscar}.
% Richard doesn't trust/understand MS.
The \gls{MS} signal is affected by dilution with carbonates~\cite{tenKateSprenger1993}, so its link to climate forcing is less direct than, for example, the \ce{CaCO3} content itself.
% it seems that the \citeA{tenKateSprenger1993} record has a _--_ pattern for the amplitudes of the short ecc in the first 4 long ecc cycles prior to the K/T
% \citeA{Dinares-Turell2013} re-analyzed this record and did some additional spectral analysis/filtering.
The \gls{MS} proxy shows a very strong negative correlation with \ce{CaCO3} in bundles \ma{1--4}~\cite{tenKateSprenger1993,Gilabert2022}.
However, clear differences were found between the intercept of this relationship before, during, and after the \gls{KT}~\cite<supplementary figure S2 in>{Gilaberg2022}.
Unfortunately, the \ce{CaCO3} record from \citeA{tenKateSprenger1993} currently spans bundles \ma{1--4} and has not yet been extended to encompass the full Maastrichtian.
Furthermore, the original study reports that their \gls{MS} values show scatter, potentially due to ``surface irregularities and the generally low values''~\cite{Batenburg2012}.
The \gls{L*} proxy, on the other hand, likely corresponds to changes in the lithology that were driven by carbonate--clay alternations~\cite{MountWard1986,Batenburg2012},
which were in turn driven by changes in wetness and climate.
We therefore argue that the color reflectance record most directly reflects the orbital forcing.

\subsection{Age Model}\label{sec:agemodel}

\ijk{re: past/present tense: actually I'm used to writing in the past tense for methods/results, but I wasn't being very consistent. Rewrote everything to past tense now.}

\ijk{something about spectral analysis? \(\to{}\), just rely on original study that showed this. But do I need to mention this? And if so, where?}

The age model for the Zumaia and Sopelana sites was based on the identification of long eccentricity minima in the field by \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.
The original study relied on foraminifera biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and astrochronology by tuning these long eccentricity minima to the long eccentricity filter of the La11 solution~\cite{Laskar2011a}. % not sure if sentence is needed
Here, we assumed a duration of \qty{405}{\kiloyear} for each of these long eccentricity cycles to arrive at an initial floating age model.
A previous best-estimate of the age of the \gls{KT} \cite<\qty{65.9}{\millionyearago},>[]{ZeebeLourens2022EPSL} anchored the floating age model to absolute time.
We then performed optimizations for each astronomical solution that allowed the age of the \gls{KT} to shift by \qty{\pm200}{\kiloyear}
and to adjust the depth for each of the long eccentricity minima tie-points (see \cref{sec:algorithm}).

\subsection{Removing Long-Term Trends}\label{sec:detrend}

Several rapid shifts in the lithology---from red, clay-rich marly intervals to whiter limestones---were observed in the Zumaia section on the order of every \qty{50}{\metre}.
This has previously been suggested to potentially indicate a \qty{1.2}{\millionyear} cycle~\cite{Batenburg2014}.
These shifts in lithology were recorded in the proxy archives of Zumaia as very rapid transitions, likely as a result of crossing some threshold value in a nonlinear climate system response.
This could hamper spectral analysis and filtering.
Therefore we used several methods of detrending the records prior to filtering: We
(1) Subtracted a linear fit and scaled (subtracted the mean and divided by the standard deviation) the result;
(2) Fit a \gls{GAM} to the record, subtracted the fit from each value, then scaled the results;
(3) Applied a lowpass filter to the record with a frequency of \qty{0.025}{\metre\per cycle}, subtracted it from each value, then scaled the results;
and (4) Applied a piecewise linear fit based on depth intervals where the lithology changes dramatically, or we observed long-term trends that were at a larger scale than long eccentricity.
The linear fits were subtracted from each value, and the results were scaled.
We have tried many ways of detrending the records, for example with larger and smaller chunks in the depth domain (\cref{fig:detrend}), or with different frequencies for the lowpass filter, and report sensitivity to this in the appendix.
% The effects that these trends can have on our results were limited because we filter only in the time-domain, after applying the age model. % Not sure if true, commented out for now.
%TODO: add link to new appendix figs

% where do we talk about filtering/spectral analysis?
% \rez{you could pad more 5x, 10x, any difference?}
% \ijk{I didn't read the docs correctly, \texttt{padfac} defaults to 5.
%     I quickly tried out 5, 10, 15, 100 times and no diff for 405 and 100 kyr filters.
%     Also tried different padfacs for taner, it just becomes way slower but other than that it's nearly identical once you have over 3x the data.}

\subsection{Finding the Best Fit}\label{sec:algorithm}

In order to test which astronomical solution provides the best match to the data
(and hence is more likely to reflect the true astronomical time scale)
we adopted and extended the approach of \citeA{ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
We applied the initial age model (\cref{sec:agemodel}) to the detrended data (\cref{sec:detrend}).
After linearly interpolating to a timestep that is a multiple of the timestep of the astronomical solution,
we filtered out the long and short eccentricity cycles.
We used a taner filter with a roll of \num{e10}, targeting periods of \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} (frequency \qty{\pm25}{\percent}) (\cref{fig:filter-windows}).
These filter parameters were selected after analyzing the sensitivity to different ways of filtering (rectangular, gaussian, different values for the taner filter roll parameter in \cref{fig:filter-windows}).

The filtered signals were added and scaled to construct an artificial ``eccentricity'' curve.
The scaled astronomical solutions were then interpolated/subset to the same timesteps as the data.
Then we calculated how well the filtered records matched the astronomical solution via the \gls{RMSD}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rmsd}
    \text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(e_{i} - f_{i})^{2}}
\end{equation}
where \(e\) is the scaled eccentricity of the astronomical solution and \(f\) is the scaled and filtered combination of long- and short eccentricity-related peaks in the data.

To study the effect of the two eccentricity cycles on the match with the astronomical solution
we assigned different weights to the two filtered signals
(relative weights of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1, 0.75:1, 0.5:1, 0.25:1, and 0:1 for the long and short eccentricity cycles respectively).
In the main manuscript, we limit our analysis to the simplest 1:1 combination because this preserves the relative amplitude of the long and short eccentricity components from the original data.

An updated age model was created by shifting the age of the \gls{KT}
by up to \qty{\pm200}{\kiloyear} in increments of \qty{2.8}{\kiloyear}
and selecting the offset that gives the lowest \gls{RMSD}.
% This means that a new estimate for the age of the \gls{KT}
% \rez{[this was quite tricky in ZL22. should probably look
% at KTB from both younger and older sides. we can discuss]}
% for each astronomical solution is an additional outcome of this study.
To account for potential errors in the tie-points---the long eccentricity minima depths as identified in the field---we iteratively shifted each tie-point from the youngest to oldest by a range of values between \qtyrange[range-phrase=~to~]{-1.6}{1.6}{\metre} in \qty{20}{\centi\metre} increments (about \qty{10}{\percent} of the long eccentricity period).
After tweaking the tie-point depth, the updated age model was applied, the record was filtered to target the long and short eccentricity cycles, and an artificial eccentricity curve was created to calculate the \gls{RMSD} as before.
Once the optimal (lowest \gls{RMSD}) tie-point depth was found, we fixed it and moved on to the next-youngest tie-point.
This was repeated until all tie-points were adjusted, resulting in the overall best fit.
We performed this analysis separately for the Zumaia and Sopelana sites, so that potential errors in the depth correlation between sites was accounted for.
Furthermore,  scaling the two sites separately should correct for differences in amplitude between the records that could be the result of differences in paleogeographic setting (i.e., the Sopelana site was likely located farther offshore than the Zumaia site~\cite{Batenburg2014}).
We also calculated a square root of the cumulative sum of the squared differences that started at the \gls{KT} and moved to older data points.
This allowed us to visualize where in the time domain the data differs most from the astronomical solutions.
\ijk{TODO:\ talk about \texttt{depth\_chunk}s for different sedimentation rate intervals vs. rolling RMSD? Maybe only in appendix text? Or not at all?}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

% first talk about how the matched filtered records look!
The matched eccentricity construct for the \gls{L*} record visually matched the different astronomical solutions reasonably well for the Zumaia--Sopelana composite across the Maastrichtian (\cref{fig:rolling-depth-age}). % too nonscientific?
% global patterns we observe
The long eccentricity cycles were closely matched to each solution, while the short eccentricity filter was in general alignment with the solutions in those intervals where the solution showed a high short eccentricity amplitude.

% describe stuff from young to old, from K/T going left
\ijk{Not sure if this paragraph is interesting enough to talk about.}
For astronomical solutions ZB18a, ZB20c, and ZB20d, the youngest Maastrichtian long eccentricity bundle \ma{1} showed a single short eccentricity cycle that is either in anti-phase with the filtered data, or has a higher amplitude shortly before the \gls{KT}.
This could be related to the gradual transition that we see in the \gls{L*} data towards the base of the \gls{KT} or to edge effects related to the bandpass filtering.
% should we talk about Ma405 bundle 2  that doesn't have high amplitude in the proxy records,
% but does have high amplitude in the relief in the field/photographs
For the next long eccentricity bundle \ma{2} the eccentricity construct had a relatively low amplitude and so did most astronomical solutions.
However, for \ma{2} visual indications based on the relief and contrast from the section photographs in \citeA<>[Fig. 2]{Batenburg2012} and \citeA<>[Fig. 5a]{Dinares-Turell2013} show relatively high amplitude in short eccentricity, with prominent precession-related marls.

We observed patterns in the relative amplitude of the long eccentricity and short eccentricity filters that may be related to \acrshortpl{VLN}.
It is difficult to distinguish \acrshortpl{VLN} in the filtered data directly, because there may have been other factors than a \gls{VLN} that resulted in a low amplitude in the short eccentricity component of the record.
For example, large changes in sedimentation rate or lithology could have disrupted the band-pass filtering.
Therefore, a more conservative approach focuses on bundles with a high amplitude in the short eccentricity cycle in the data.
The records show higher amplitude of short eccentricity in bundle \ma{5}, matching well with all astronomical solutions under evaluation here.
Crucially, however, some astronomical solutions have a low amplitude in the short eccentricity component in intervals where the data showed a relatively high amplitude.
This could indicate that a \gls{VLN} was absent from this interval and that the computed astronomical solution was different from the actual astronomical forcing that the Earth experienced.

In bundle \ma{5} (\appr\qty{67.8}{\millionyearago}) ZB20b has a relatively lower amplitude (with a \gls{VLN} in \ma{6}) than our eccentricity construct, whereas ZB20c and ZB20d matches the data more closely and ZB20a matches it in amplitude but seems slightly out of phase.

The highest-amplitude interval in the record occurred in bundle \ma{8} (\appr\qty{68.9}{\millionyearago}).
This bundle features a darker marly interval at around \qty{117}{\metre}, which corresponds to a strong excursion in both \gls{L*} and \gls{MS} (in the opposite direction) that closely matches the duration of one short eccentricity cycle.
It is referred to as ``escal\'{o}n'' (step), and was previously also associated with a short eccentricity maximum, while other causes such as regional factors or tectonic events could not be excluded~\cite{Dinares-Turell2013}.
% TODO: double-check the cycle counts between the two studies
% There is a giant offset in the composite depth between Dinares-Turell 2013 and Batenburg 2012/2014. At least 86% more section in DT13.
% Dinares-Turell 2013 depth of 220 m is coincident with Batenburg 2012/2014 depth of 180 m = 40 m
% and 100 m = 120 m. = 20 m
% in Dinares-Turell 2013 the escalón occurs between short E31 and E32 (based on filter of CaCO3 for upper part)
% if I count the short ecc cycles identified in the field by Batenburg 2012, escalón is between E33 and E34
This high amplitude of our eccentricity construct is significant, because solutions ZB18a, and ZB20c have a low amplitude of short eccentricity in this interval.
La10b may have a \gls{VLN} somewhere between \ma{7} and \ma{8} and also has a poor match with the data.

During \ma{10} (\appr\qty{69.7}{\millionyearago}) the composite record also indicated a high amplitude of short eccentricity, resulting in a mismatch with ZB20b and to a lesser extent La10c (where the \gls{VLN} seems to occur between \ma{9} and \ma{10}).

% then describe simple "what is the best RMSD-scoring solution?"
The overall fits between our eccentricity constructs and the astronomical solutions (as measured by the \gls{RMSD}) were relatively similar between the different astronomical solutions.
The best (lowest \gls{RMSD}) match was observed between astronomical solution ZB20a and the \gls{L*} eccentricity construct (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-all}).
The \gls{MS} proxy matched the La10c and ZB20d solutions best, while
the \gls{d13C}-proxy, as indicated in the methods, does not capture short-eccentricity variability to such an extent that it can be used to differentiate meaningfully between astronomical solutions.

The cumulative \gls{RMSD} scores indicate when our eccentricity constructs diverged to what extent from the astronomical solutions (\cref{fig:cum-RMSD-all}).
Solutions ZB18a, ZB20c, and ZB20d all show a rapid increase in the cumulative \gls{RMSD} score at around \qty{65.9}{\millionyearago}, which represents the mismatch in the first short eccentricity cycle just prior to the \gls{KT}.
Overall for \gls{L*}, solutions ZB20a and ZB20b outperformed the other solutions up to \appr\qty{69.6}{\millionyearago}, after which ZB20b also develops a mismatch for the Sopelana site.
The rolling \gls{RMSD} scores also highlight that none of the astronomical solutions showed an amplitude that is as large as the eccentricity construct in \ma{8}, resulting in a rapid increase of the cumulative \gls{RMSD} scores for all astronomical solutions under evaluation for this interval.
The rolling \gls{RMSD} score only increased slightly in \ma{10} for ZB20b, whereas we see a clear coincidence of a \gls{VLN} in the solution paired with a relatively high amplitude in the eccentricity construct.
During this interval, the rolling \gls{RMSD} score for ZB20a steadily increases at a slower rate, and therefore results in a better overall match.
It appears that the strong negative excursions in our eccentricity construct
at \qty{69.1}{\millionyearago} in ZB20a (oldest part of \ma{8})
and at \qty{70.4}{\millionyearago} in ZB20b (oldest part of \ma{11})
have a great deal of influence on the rolling \gls{RMSD} scores.

Unsurprisingly, these descriptions of the patterns in our eccentricity constructs and the \gls{RMSD} scores and cumulative \gls{RMSD} scores indicate that none of the astronomical solutions fully explain the patterns that we extracted from the proxy archives of the Zumaia and Sopelana field sections.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

Our results were relatively sensitive to the choices of the proxy archive we used, how we detrended the record to subtract non-cyclical patterns, and how we performed band-pass filtering.
% proxy
We show the eccentricity constructs based on \gls{MS} and \gls{d13C} against the astronomical solutions in the time domain in the appendix (\cref{fig:rolling-age-MS,fig:rolling-age-d13C}) and include their \gls{RMSD} scores in \cref{fig:full-RMSD-all}.
The \gls{d13C} archive from Zumaia shows a better match with ZB20c and La10b, but the differences are very minor.
Visually, differences between the fits to different astronomical solutions are hard to distinguish in the time domain (\cref{fig:rolling-age-d13C}).
The \gls{MS} proxy results in the best fits with ZB20d, ZB20c, and to a lesser extent La10c, ZB18a, and La10b, which can be partially explained because the \gls{MS} record shows a high amplitude in \ma{6}, whereas ZB20a, ZB20b, and La10c have a \gls{VLN} here.
There is also a high amplitude during \ma{8}, which coincides with a \gls{VLN} in ZB20c, ZB18a, and to a lesser extent La10b.
Finally, \ma{10} and \ma{11} also show high amplitude, which rules out ZB20b and La10c.
See the methods for reasons to prefer the \gls{L*} proxy over the \gls{MS} and \gls{d13C} proxies for our purposes.

% boot
One approach to estimate the uncertainty of our \gls{RMSD} scores, is to perform bootstrapping.
The data were randomly resampled many (i.e., \num{e5}) times to the same size as the original data, but with repeated sampling (i.e., some measurements were included twice or more while others were excluded randomly).
Then, the \gls{RMSD} scores were calculated for each of these subsets.
This resulted in a distribution of \gls{RMSD} scores for each proxy against each astronomical solution (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-boot}).
These bootstrapped scores indicate that the differences between eccentricity constructs based on the \gls{d13C} proxy records for the different astronomical solutions were likely not significant,
while the lower score for the \gls{L*} ZB20a solution
and the higher score for \gls{MS} solution ZB20b
likely was.
% commented out b/c calculating an average from a bivariate dist isn't fun
%For a simple average of the bootstrapped values across all proxies, the means overlapped at the \qty{68}{\percent} confidence level.
%After excluding the \gls{d13C} proxy, all astronomical solutions except for ZB20b (which performed worse because of the high \gls{RMSD} score for \gls{MS}) showed a similar overlap.
We hesitate to perform further statistical testing, however, since the next sections will show how sensitive our \gls{RMSD} scores were to different parameter choices that resulted in a different alignment between the proxy record and the astronomical solutions.

% tie-points
The algorithm that allowed changing the depth of each long eccentricity minimum as identified in the field improved the \gls{RMSD} scores quite dramatically (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-tie}).
However, it is sensitive to the extent to which we shifted the record in order to arrive at the best fit and to which we allowed the tiepoint depths to vary.
% shift
For example, if we let the record shift by up to \qty{400}{\kiloyear}\rez{too much} instead of the \qty{200}{\kiloyear} used throughout the manuscript, as one would expect, an offset of more than one long eccentricity cycle was often observed.
This is probably incorrect but happened to result in a better fit with those particular astronomical solutions.
Shifting the record by anywhere between \qtyrange{100}{300}{\kiloyear} typically resulted in an identical fit, however.

% tiepoint tweaks
Furthermore, allowing each \rez{tie point} tiepoint depth to vary by larger distance than our default value of \qty{1.6}{\metre} (about \qty{10}{\percent} of the long eccentricity cycle) usually results in slightly better \gls{RMSD} scores (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-tie-error}).
\ijk{[Do I want \emph{another} figure of the RMSD scores vs. the tiepoint error? I've included it but might want to omit it.]}
Furthermore, a tiepoint error of up to 3 meters can result in an \gls{RMSD} score for the ZB18a solution that is similar to that of the ZB20a solution.
Visually, the presence of the \gls{VLN} in \ma{8} in ZB18a coincident with the large amplitude does not agree with the simple score, however.
As a quality control, we visualized the \gls{RMSD} scores for each tiepoint adjustment against depth to make sure that a local minimum was found and that the resulting eccentricity construct did not show any too rapid changes in sedimentation rate (see \cref{fig:tiepoint-RMSD-optima} for an example).

% Changing this to 3, 4, or 5 meters usually results in a better fit that looks nicer and gets a better RMSD score
% 200 kyr + 3 m offset always gives visually similar results but with better RMSD scores.
%For ZB20a, our 1.6 m result goes from \num{1.02} to 3 m \num{0.986}.
%For ZB18a, our 1.6 m result goes from \num{1.08} to 3 m \num{0.989} and is then on-par with ZB20a.
%Setting it to 3, 4, or 5 m would move the K/T boundary up by 3 m, and the same for the minimum after Ma405-1 for ZB18a
%But could their 400 kyr minima idenification really be off by that much?]}
\ijk{[talk about short ecc count offset between \cite{Batenburg2012} and \cite{Dinares-Turell2013}. Not sure if this should be discussion.]}
\rez{It doesn't change the results, [illegible]}

% detrend
Different ways of detrending the proxy records to subtract non-cyclical patterns also lead to different results (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-detrend}).
Overall, the different ways of detrending the record (\cref{fig:detrend}) showed similar patterns, but the \gls{RMSD} scores for some solutions varied more between different ways of detrending than between different astronomical solutions (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-detrend}).
The large changes in lithology result in a very large amplitude of the short eccentricity filter in the simple detrending approach.
For most solutions, this simply results in a worse fit.
But for ZB20a and La10b, using a different detrending strategy makes our algorithm shift the long- eccentricity tiepoint depths enough that it is offset by about one short eccentricity cycle (\cref{fig:Lstar-detrend}), resulting in an even worse fit.

% filter
% window: gaussian, rectangular, taner
\rez{The bandpass filtering window used} also affected the results (\cref{fig:filter-windows}).
The gaussian window performed worst (after rescaling it so the comparison uses similar filter widths, see \cref{fig:filter-windows}), followed by a rectangular filter, while the taner filter with intermediate roll parameters resulted in a lower \gls{RMSD} (performed better).
% taner roll parameter: more rectangular to more gaussian to more t-dist
As one would expect, taner filters with a very high roll parameter (i.e., \num{e100}) performed very similar to the rectangular filter.
Taner roll parameters with a relatively smooth window (\(\texttt{roll} \ge 10^{8}\) and \(\le 10^{12}\)), made our algorithm shift the eccentricity construct by one short eccentricity cycle against the ZB20a solution, resulting in a much better fit (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-filter,fig:filter-windows}).
% frac: window width, ±XX% of the target frequency
The same type of shift occurred when we changed the width of the filters (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-frac}).

% comb: weight of long and short ecc
\rez{Applying a different weighting to the long- and short eccentricity filters, typically resulted in} better \gls{RMSD} scores than the 1:1 combination (\cref{fig:full-RMSD-comb}).
However, these effects seemed relatively uniform across all astronomical solutions.
We therefore prefer using the 1:1 solution so that the relative filter amplitude is preserved from the original data.

\rez{rewrite this paragraph}
Together, these sensitivity analyses show that arbitrarily picking a detrending strategy and filter criteria may result in different findings [[than if you]]??? explore the parameter space for robustness and correctness.
Furthermore, they may indicate that at this moment we do not have a Maastrichtian record that is able to distinguish between the astronomical solutions that are available at present. \rez{the latter conclusion is contrary to the abstract. either way is fine with me but need to be consistent.}

\rez{wording in sections above needs cosmetics}


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

This study aims to determine which, if any, astronomical solutions best match the Maastrichtian proxy records of the Zumaia and Sopelana sites, in order to arrive at an astronomically calibrated time scale.
Ultimately, these results will allows us to anchor events in Earth's geologic past and to distinguish forcings and feedbacks in the climate system.

During the Paleocene, solutions La10b and La10c showed a poor match with data from the Walvis Ridge, lacking a \gls{VLN} at around \qty{61}{\millionyearago}~\cite{ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
Our analysis shows that solutions ZB18a and ZB20c and to a lesser extent La10b are incompatible with the high amplitude in the data from Zumaia at \ma{5}.
Then, as we move to the older part of the record, the Sopelana data best matches ZB20a because ZB20b has a very long eccentricity node at \ma{10} (\appr\qty{69.7}{\millionyearago}), whereas the amplitude of the record is large there.
Therefore, the ZB20a solution is most compatible with the available Maastrichtian data and could be used for tuning up to \appr\qty{71}{\millionyearago}.

Our sensitivity analysis shows that the methodology is quite sensitive to parameter choices, however.
This may be the result of the proxy archive itself, which, while showing a clear preference for the ZB20a solution when looking at the \gls{L*} proxy,
\ijk{finish that thought.}

\ijk{[This paragraph is not done: Can we look at multiple sites? literature comparison, only visual]}
%Previous studies have also indicated the presence of a high amplitude of the short-eccentricity cycle in \ma{8} in ODP Site 1262 and to a lesser extent in 1209. % where did I see this?
Contrast to: Zumaia, ODP 1262, and 1267 \ma{1} and \ma{2}~\cite{Westerhold2008} figure 4.
% this is all Husson2011:
525A gray level bundle 1 (fig 4)
1267B MS 1--6.5 (fig 4) but note that they did not use the splice table from~\cite{Westerhold2008} to convert from MBSF to RMCD.
762C bundles 1 to 5.5 (fig 4)
525A gray level smoothed 6--9 (fig 3) hard to tell...
762C gray level smoothed bundles 8 to 16 (fig 3) indicates potential hiatus within this bundle but also high change
1258A MS \ma{8--14} (fig 3) no recovery in 10
of~\citeA{Husson2011}.
The key intervals of \ma{5}, \ma{8}, and \ma{10} are XXX.


Future studies should aim to generate high resolution proxy records that have recorded the expression of both long and short eccentricity and connect to the oldest geologically constrained parts of the astronomical solutions.
It may be wise to target low latitudes for this, since eccentricity-related cyclicity tends to dominate in the tropics~\cite<Fig. 7a in>[]{LaeppleLohmann2009}. % during the late Pleistocene (750 ka to present) in model
% but of course the above depends on which proxy you're looking at... cut the sentence out?
We further suggest that future studies generate new astronomical solutions with similar initial settings to the ZB20a solution and, using appropriate parameter variations, explore this crucial chaotic horizon of the solar system.

    The taner filter has the main-text roll parameter of \num{e10}.
    Note that the way \texttt{astrochron} parametrizes the gaussian (dark red triangles) window width is not directly comparable to the taner (black circles) and rectangular (grey squares) filters.
    Therefore, we have reparametrized the gaussian filter so that it intersects the taner filters where they cross the rectangular filter,

    Note that the way \texttt{astrochron} parameterizes the Gaussian window width is not directly comparable to the taner and rectangular filters.
    %Setting the Gaussian filter alpha to a value to match the width of the taners could work, but would cut off any lower/higher frequencies.
    Therefore, we also show a reparametrized Gaussian filter
    %where the upper and lower boundaries correspond to \(\pm2\sigma\) (darkred gaussian).

\ijk{\textbf{TODO:} come up with nice package name (working title: \texttt{AstronomicalSolutions} so it's broad enough for future additions) and host on github/ archive on Zenodo.}

%
%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

% Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
%  will not be numbered, e.g.,:
%  \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

%  Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
%  be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
%  \begin{equation}
%  x^2=y^2 + z^2
%  \end{equation}


% % To create multiline equations, use the
% % \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% % as demonstrated below.
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
%   y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
% \end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
