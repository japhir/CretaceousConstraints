\section*{quick links to most relevant sections for Richard}
Hi Richard, here are some links to the most relevant figures.

\begin{itemize}
\item See \cref{fig:rolling-rmsd} for the most recent figure of filtered Zumaia/Sopelana records compared to La10b, La10c, ZB18a, and ZB20a solutions. This uses the rolling overall best \gls{RMSD} scores as they improve by tweaking each tiepoint uncertainty. There is still an issue with the \acrshort{d13C} tiepoints.
\item See \cref{fig:rolling-depth} and \cref{fig:rolling-age} for what those record matches look like in the depth and time domain.
\end{itemize}



\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
``Cool quote that addresses how crucial good dating is.'' (I like how some of RZ's paper's start with an ancient quote).
Maybe something from \citeA{Berger1980} review?

As we move to older and older time-periods, the available records will get further distorted and

\rez{
In this work, we use geological data to constrain astronomical solution in order to most accurately reflect the orbit of the Earth;
for previous work on the Paleocene and Eocene, see \citeA{ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
The Walvis Ridge record is exceptional in its quality, so finding comparable records that capture precession-scale alternations
and patterns of amplitude modulation for older time periods is difficult at this time.
}

Zumaia/Sopelana terrestrial composite records, as generated by \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

Here we aim to use the best available records older than the K/T boundary to constrain which astronomical solution best reflects this time period.



\section{Material and Methods}\label{sec:mm}

\subsection{Datasets Used}\label{sec:data}
\citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

Site descriptions for Zumaia and Sopelana

Age model \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima as identified in the field

We use proxy records \gls{MS}, \gls{d13C}, and \gls{L*} measurements.

\subsection{Removing Long-Term Trends}\label{sec:detrend}

We have used various ways of getting rid of long-term trends in the record. This is important because there are some significant shifts in the lithology that could potentially hamper spectral analysis. The effect of these long-term shifts on bandpass-filtering are limited.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab:detrend_types}The different detrend methods to remove long-term trends prior to spectral analysis.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
name & method\\
\hline
\texttt{value} & The raw value. Often I still remove a linear trend from the spectral analysis call.\\
\texttt{scl} & The scaled (or normalized = mean subtracted, divided by standard deviation) value.\\
\texttt{lin\_scl} & Remove linear trends from red/white intervals separately, then scale the result.\\
\texttt{gam\_det} & Subtract a gam from the value, then scale the result.\\
\texttt{lin\_gam\_det} & First do \texttt{lin\_scl} from above, then do \texttt{gam\_det}.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{Zumaia-Sopelana_records_complicated.png}
\caption{\label{fig:detrend}Zumaia and Sopelana trend removal using various strategies. See \cref{tab:detrend_types} for an overview.}
\end{figure}

% \texttt{value} Use the proxy value as reported in the original study. This does not exclude linear interpolation, demeaning (subtracting the mean) and detrending (subtracting a linear fit for the whole record) for certain spectral analysis tools.

% \texttt{scl} Subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation results in a normalized or scaled value.

% \texttt{gam\_det}
% A gam is a generalized additive model with integrated smoothness estimation. We fit this smooth curve and then subtract it from the original proxy value.

% \texttt{lin\_scl}
% We fit a linear model for each of the red, white, and orange intervals separately. Then we subtract these models from the raw proxy value to get a detrended result.

% \texttt{lin\_gam\_det}
% First remove linear trends, then fit a gam to results and subtract that.

\subsection{Spectral Analysis and Filtering}\label{sec:spectral}
Various methods for spectral analysis were performed.

FFT, Blackman-Tukey, Lomb-Scargle, MTM, MTLS.

Bandpass filters targetting the \qtylist{405;100}{\kiloyear} cycles.

\subsection{Finding the Best Fit}

The function the function \texttt{wrap\_age\_model} finds the optimal age model.
It compares the \texttt{data} with the astronomical solution (\texttt{astronomical\_solution}, can only contain one, e.g. \texttt{ZB18a}) based on the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima as identified in the field (\texttt{agemodel}), and applies an input uncertainty (\texttt{tiepoint\_uncertainty}, a vector of adjustments to make to each tiepoint).
After tweaking the tiepoint, the altered agemodel is applied, the record is filtered for the \qtylist{405;100}{\kiloyear} cycles and an artificial ``eccentricity'' curve is created.
The astronomical solution is interpolated to the same timesteps as the data, and the \gls{RMSD} is calculated.
It then loops through all tiepoints and all tiepoint uncertainties to find the overall best fit to the astronomical solution.


\begin{enumerate}
\item apply the agemodel from the field to the detrended record
\item for the youngest 405 kyr tiepoint
\begin{enumerate}
\item for each tiepoint depth error
\begin{enumerate}
\item apply the new age model to the record
\item apply a 405 and 100 kyr filter (based on general depth filter ranges determined before)
\item compute ``eccentricity'' construct by combining the normalized filters
\item interpolate orbital solution to the record's timesteps
\item calculate SD for each timestep
\item calculate RMSD
\end{enumerate}
\item filter out the lowest RMSD score, get the best tie\_error for this 405 kyr minimum
\end{enumerate}
\item move on to next youngest 405 kyr minimum and repeat from step 2.
\end{enumerate}

This function now takes about \qty{30.6}{\second} to run when I compare a single Zumaia MS record against a single astronomical solution. That's fast enough for now.

\textbf{TODO:} Mathify this explanation

    Best \gls{RMSD} scores for different astronomical solutions (x-axis), sites (column panels), detrend types (colours), and proxies (row panels) in different \texttt{comb}'s (shape, linetype).
    This analysis relies on iteratively shifting the tiepoints by small increments up to \textpm{}4 m and calculating the \gls{RMSD} for the whole record at each iteration to decide which tiepoint error gives the best fit.
    \textbf{NOTE:} Zumaia \gls{d13C} records are not correct, they miss a 405 kyr cycle!

    Gray dots show all tiepoint uncertainties looked at (\textpm{}4 m), with the optimal (lowest overal \gls{RMSD} score) tiepoint marked in purple.
    Numbers indicate \gls{RMSD} score for the adjacent fit.
    \textbf{NOTE}: mistake in the \gls{d13C} record, where the uncertainties were so large that they allow the fitting function to skip a 405 kyr cycle.
    \textbf{NOTE}: Sopelana top is not linked to Zumaia base best tiepoint uncertainty.

 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
