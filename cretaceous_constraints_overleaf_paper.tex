\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\ijk{I've focused on the figures, results, and discussion first!}

\ijk{I like how some of RZ's paper's start with an ancient quote}
``Cool quote that addresses how crucial good dating is''.
Maybe something from \citeA{Berger1980} review? Or perhaps \citeA{Berger1989}.

As we move to older and older time-periods, the available records will get further distorted and \ijk{TODO}.

\ijk{@REZ: I just added \cite{Westerhold2017} here. They make the comparison between data and several solutions and comment on implications, but it's not so explicit.}

In this work, we use geological data to constrain astronomical solution in order to most accurately reflect the orbit of the Earth; for previous work on the Paleocene and Eocene, see \citeA{Westerhold2017,ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
The Walvis Ridge records are exceptional in their quality, so finding comparable records that capture precession-scale alternations and patterns of amplitude modulation for older time periods is difficult at this time.

We use the Zumaia and Sopelana terrestrial composite records, as generated by \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

Here we aim to use the best available records older than the \gls{KT} boundary (informal use) to constrain which astronomical solution best reflects this time period.

Something to introduce long eccentricity (\qty{405}{\kiloyear} period) and short eccentricity (\qty{100}{\kiloyear} period).

Also introduce very long eccentricity nodes!


\section{Material and Methods}\label{sec:mm}

\ijk{\textbf{TODO:} Decide on consistent naming for scaled vs.\ normalized vs.\ standardized: subtract mean, divide by standard deviation. I like scaled?}

\subsection{Datasets Used}\label{sec:data}

We have considered several continental sections and sea floor drill core sites (\cref{tab:sites}).
\ijk{Just went through the table again, 1267 still looks promising and so does U1403.}
We think that the Zumaia and Sopelana field sections show the clearest orbitally-forced patterns for the Maastrichtian, with continuous high-resolution records and an established astronomically forced hierarchy of bundling patterns~\cite{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.
\ijk{TODO:\ something on where Zumaia was first described? I think that's in \cite{Pujalte1993}}

\ijk{TODO:\ Site descriptions for Zumaia and Sopelana.}
\ijk{TODO:\ talk about small turbidites}

We use proxy records \gls{MS}, \gls{d13C}, and \gls{L*} measurements from \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}, but  focus on \gls{L*} in the main manuscript.
The \gls{d13C} proxy is more sensitive to lower frequency orbital forcing~\cite{Zeebe2017,Kocken2019loscar} and shows long eccentricity forcing clearly but the short eccentricity is less clearly expressed.
For \gls{MS} it is unclear how it relates to the climate forcing, %Richard doesn't trust/understand it.
\ijk{TODO: find refs to support this}
while \gls{L*} likely corresponds to changes in the lithology that have been driven by carbonate--clay alternations, which are in turn driven by changes in wetness and climate.
We argue that the color reflectance record most directly reflects the orbital forcing.

\subsection{Age Model}\label{sec:agemodel}

\ijk{actually I'm used to past tense for methods, but I guess I wasn't being very consistent. Rewrote to present tense now.}.

The age model for the Zumaia and Sopelana sites is based on the identification of long eccentricity minima in the field \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.
We assume a duration of \qty{405}{\kiloyear} for each of these long eccentricity cycles to arrive at a floating age model.
A previous best-estimate of the age of the \gls{KT} boundary \cite<\qty{65.9}{\millionyearago},>[]{ZeebeLourens2022EPSL} anchors the floating age model to absolute time.
We later perform optimizations for each astronomical solution that allow the age of the \gls{KT} boundary to shift by \qty{\pm200}{\kiloyear} (see \cref{sec:algorithm}).

\subsection{Removing Long-Term Trends}\label{sec:detrend}

There are a few significant shifts in the lithology (red, clay-rich intervals and whiter marl-rich intervals) that could hamper spectral analysis and filtering.
We limit the effect these trends can have on our results by filtering only in the time-domain, after applying the age model.
To account for these long-term changes in the proxy records, we use several methods of detrending the record:
0. We subtract a linear fit and scale (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) the result;
1. We fit a \gls{GAM} to the record, subtract the fit from each value, then scale the results;
2. We apply a lowpass filter to the record with a frequency of \qty{0.025}{\metre\per cycle}, subtract it from each value, then scale the results;
and 3. We apply piecewise linear fits based on depth intervals where the lithology changes dramatically, or we observe long-term trends that are at a larger scale than long eccentricity.
We subtract the linear fits from each value and scale the results.

We have tried many ways of detrending the records, for example with larger and smaller chunks in the depth domain, or with different frequencies for the lowpass filter, and report sensitivity to this in the appendix.
%TODO: add link to new appendix figs

% don't think I need this here (\cref{sec:agemodel})

\rez{you could pad more 5x, 10x, any difference?}
\ijk{I didn't read the docs correctly, defaults to 5. I quickly tried out 5, 10, 15, 100 times and no diff for 405 and 100 kyr filters.}
\ijk{also tried different padfacs for taner, it just becomes way slower but other than that it's nearly identical once you have over 3x the data.}

\subsection{Finding the Best Fit}\label{sec:algorithm}

In order to test which astronomical solution provides the best match to the data
(and hence a proper astronomical time scale)
we adopt and extend the approach of \citeA{ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
The detrended data (\cref{sec:detrend}) is combined with the initial age model (\cref{sec:agemodel}) to arrive at the time domain.
After linearly interpolating to a timestep that is a multiple of the timestep of the astronomical solution, we filter targeting the long and short eccentricity cycles.
We use a taner filter with a roll of \num{e10} targeting periods of \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} (frequency \qty{\pm30}{\percent}).
The filtered signals are added and scaled to construct an artificial ``eccentricity'' curve.
The scaled astronomical solutions are then interpolated/subset to the same timesteps as the data, and the \gls{RMSD} is calculated:
\ijk{do you think this is needed or leave it out?}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rmsd}
    \text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(e_{i} - f_{i})^{2}}
\end{equation}
where \(e\) is the eccentricity of the astronomical solution and \(f\) is the scaled and filtered combination of long- and short eccentricity.

%% To study the effect of the two cycles on the match with the astronomical solution, we also looked at the effect of assigning different weights to the two filtered signals (weights of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1, 0.75:1, 0.5:1, 0.25:1, and 0:1 for the long and short eccentricity cycles respectively).
\ijk{TODO:\ Decide how/if I want to talk about different combinations of long and short ecc components (1:1 vs. 0.5:1 etc).}

We update the initial age model by minimizing the \gls{RMSD} after offsetting the records by up to \qty{\pm200}{\kiloyear}.
To account for potential errors in the tie-points---the long eccentricity minima depths as identified in the field (see \cref{sec:agemodel})---we iteratively shift each tie-point from the youngest to oldest by a range of values between \qtyrange[range-phrase=~to~]{-1.6}{1.6}{\metre} in \qty{20}{\centi\metre} increments (about \qty{10}{\percent} of the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} period).
After tweaking the tie-point depth, the altered agemodel is applied, the record is filtered to target the long and short eccentricity cycles, and an artificial eccentricity curve is created to calculate the \gls{RMSD} as before.
Once the optimal (lowest \gls{RMSD}) tie-point depth is found, we fix it and move on to the next-youngest tie-point.
This is repeated until all tie-points have been adjusted, resulting in the overall best fit.
This analysis is performed separately for the Zumaia and Sopelana sites, so that potential errors in the depth correlation between sites can be corrected for.

We also calculate a square root of the cumulative sum of the squared differences starting at the \gls{KT}-boundary and moving to older data points.
This allows us to visualize where the time domain the data differs most from the astronomical solutions.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\ijk{something about spectral analysis? \(\to{}\) No, just rely on original study that showed this.}

\ijk{introduce Ma\(_{405}\)X numbering from~\cite{Husson2011}---nvm this was already done in \citeA{Westerhold2008}.}

% first talk about how the matched filtered records look!

% FIGURE 1
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Lstar-vs-solutions.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:rolling-depth-age}
    \textbf{Maastrichtian Zumaia (purple) and Sopelana (orange) inverted filtered/normalized \gls{L*} records tuned to astronomical solutions (black, first 7 panels).}
    % This uses short linear detrending to correct for changes in sediment composition (\cref{sec:detrend}).
    %We also show Zumaia above and below \qty{109.26}{\metre} to account for the change in the sedimentation rate and lithology.
    Bottom three panels show the record in the depth domain.
    Bottom panel shows the log of the two sites, adapted from \citeA{Batenburg2014}.
    Then \gls{L*} values are shown with different ways of detrending in coloured lines (\cref{sec:detrend}).
    The record after piecewise-linear detrendeding and normalization is shown after that.
    Vertical lines show long eccentricity minima as identified in the field,
    with adjustments of up to \qty{\pm1.6}{\metre} (horizontal segments)
    and how they were matched to each astronomical solution in the time domain to minimize their \gls{RMSD} (see \cref{sec:algorithm}).
    \ijk{TODO: I'd like to illustrate long ecc/short ecc filters separately,
         but they are different for each one (= too many lines).
         A nice place to do this would be in the 3rd panel from the bottom (detrended record),
         but I never filter in the depth domain for my analysis and that might be confusing?}
    }
    \ijk{TODO: add Ma405 numbering to make referring to certain intervals easier?}
\end{figure}

% then describe simple "what is the best RMSD-scoring solution?"
\gls{RMSD}-scores are very similar between the different astronomical solutions.
The combined \gls{L*} record of the Zumaia and Sopelana section gives the best \gls{RMSD} score for
% La10b (\num{1.06}) and ZB18a (\num{1.06}) (\cref{fig:full-RMSD}).???

% FIGURE 2
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{full_RMSD_scores_all.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:full-RMSD-all}
        \gls{RMSD} scores of compilation of Zumaia and Sopelana proxy records against several orbital solutions.
        % Tie-point depths were adjusted to arrive at the best match with each solution (\cref{sec:algorithm}). % not needed?
    }
\end{figure}

% but we can also look at how it changes through time
\ijk{TODO:\ update this older section where I looked at discrete chunks.}
This analysis can be improved by looking at specific depth intervals separately, however.
The full Zumaia record gives the lowest \gls{RMSD}-scores for the La10b (\num{1.055}) and ZB20b (\num{1.120}) solutions,
while the Sopelana site gives the best results for ZB20a (\num{0.872}) and ZB18a (\num{0.894}), and to a lesser extent ZB20c (\num{0.959}) and La10c (\num{0.968}).
For Zumaia we also analyzed the record separately for two depth intervals to account for a change in sedimentation rate at around \qty{109.26}{\metre}.
The older interval shows a better match with the La10c (\num{0.981}) and ZB20b (1.001) solutions.
The younger interval has a slightly better match for La10b (\num{1.104}), ZB20a (\num{1.105}), and ZB20b (\num{1.116}), but results show similar \gls{RMSD} scores.

% \subsection{Very long eccentricity nodes}
Looking beyond the \gls{RMSD} scores, additional patterns may be used as criteria for selecting appropriate astronomical solutions.
\cref{fig:rolling-depth-age} shows our filtered, normalized records tuned to the astronomical solutions, highlighting where the records match the solutions better or worse.
The key differentiating factors between astronomical solutions are the locations of the very long eccentricity nodes, where the amplitude of the short eccentricity cycle is very low and the long eccentricity cycle dominates.
Because of the filtering approach it is difficult to distinguish these very long eccentricity nodes in the filtered data directly, because there may be non-orbital reasons to get a low-amplitude in the filtered short eccentricity cycle.
We can, however, detect sections with a high amplitude in the short eccentricity cycle, indicating the absence of a very long eccentricity node.

\ijk{hmm already make this conclusion or first describe that it has low amplitude in the short ecc component here and put below in discussion/conclusion?}

The high amplitude of the short eccentricity filtered records indicate that Ma405\(_{8}\) at around \qty{68.9}{\millionyearago} was probably not a very long eccentricity node.
This is significant, because solutions La10b, ZB18a, and ZB20c have a low amplitude of short eccentricity here.
The same goes for Ma405\(_{10}\) at \qty{69.7}{\millionyearago}, which does not match La10c and ZB20b.

%TODO: update appendix overview/comparison figure
% nitty-gritty:
Different ways of detrending of the proxy records to subtract non-cyclical patterns (\cref{fig:detrend}) lead to slightly different results.
Furthermore, changing the parameters of the taner filter has an effect: when using a more rectangular window (roll of \num{e10} or a smoother window (roll of \(10^{3}\)) results in different ``best'' solutions.
\rez{IMPORTANT: double check gauss. for gauss with $\pm 1 \sigma$ about equal to rectangular window, results should be very similar.}
\ijk{I don't know how gauss window is parameterized, but seems like boundaries are at extremes (visually lower/higher than 95\% CI. That's why I describe this as effectively shrinking the window. I also tried in Analyseries but there it's even more obscure how they do it.}
\ijk{We talked about this and it was indeed how the gaussian window is parameterized in astrochron. Switched to taner filters.}
See \cref{fig:full-RMSD-detrend} for a comparison of \gls{RMSD} scores across all detrend types, ways of filtering, different proxies, and whether or not we performed our tie-point adjustments (\cref{sec:algorithm}). \ijk{TODO}

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

This study aims to find out which, if any, astronomical solutions best match the highest-quality Maastrichtian proxy records of the Zumaia and Sopelana sites, in order to arrive at an astronomically calibrated time scale.

The youngest interval for Zumaia shows a slight preference for solutions La10b, ZB20a, and ZB20b (\cref{fig:cum-RMSD}).
For the deeper/older part of the Zumaia record, only La10c (and to a lesser extent La10b) and ZB20b have good scores because ZB20a does not have a very long eccentricity node at Ma405\(_{8}\) (\appr\qty{68.9}{\millionyearago}), whereas the record clearly does.
Solutions La10b and La10c showed a poorer match already in the late Cretaceous, where they did not show a very long eccentricity node at around \qty{61}{\millionyearago} whereas the Walvis Ridge data did \cite{ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
Then as we move to the older section the Sopelana data results in a best score for ZB20a because ZB20b has a very long eccentricity node at Ma405\(_{10}\) (\appr\qty{69.7}{\millionyearago}), whereas the amplitude of the record is large there.
Therefore, we prefer the ZB20b solution up to \appr\qty{69.2}{\millionyearago}.
For studies working with data older than this we must conclude that the data do not support any of the currently available solutions that are also consistent with data from the late Cretaceous.

We suggest that future studies generate new astronomical solutions with similar initial settings to the ZB20b solution and, using appropriate parameter variations, attempt to reproduce the patterns in the \gls{L*} record of the Sopelana site.


% This study shows some of the sensitivity of the different detrending/filtering techniques for astronomical calibration.

    The large changes in lithology result in a very large amplitude filter in the simple detrending approach.
    For most solutions, this simply results in a worse fit, but for ZB20a and La10b it makes our algorithm shift the long-eccentricity tiepoint depths enough that it gets offset by about one short-eccentricty cycle, resulting in an even worse fit.

    Note that the way \texttt{astrochron} parametrizes the gaussian window width (narrower gaussian, better RMSD scores) is not directly comparable to the taner and rectangular filters.
    Therefore, we also show a reparametrized gaussian filter, where the upper and lower boundaries correspond to \(\pm\sigma\).
    % We experimentally found that multiplying the fraction of the target frequency added/subtracted to determine the lower and upper bounds by three matched a true normal distribution best.
    Different roll parameters for the taner filters are shown,

    \num{e6}, \num{e8}, \num{e10}, \num{e12}, and \num{e100} (approaching the rectangular filter).
    We show MTM-spectral peaks of the astronomical solutions analyzed in this study in black for reference.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

% Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
%  will not be numbered, e.g.,:
%  \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

%  Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
%  be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
%  \begin{equation}
%  x^2=y^2 + z^2
%  \end{equation}


% % To create multiline equations, use the
% % \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% % as demonstrated below.
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
%   y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
% \end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
