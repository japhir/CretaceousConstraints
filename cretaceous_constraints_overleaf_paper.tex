\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

``Cool quote that addresses how crucial good dating is''.
(I like how some of RZ's paper's start with an ancient quote).
Maybe something from \citeA{Berger1980} review?

As we move to older and older time-periods, the available records will get further distorted and

In this work, we use geological data to constrain astronomical solution in order to most accurately reflect the orbit of the Earth; for previous work on the Paleocene and Eocene, see\citeA{ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
The Walvis Ridge record is exceptional in its quality, so finding comparable records that capture precession-scale alternations and patterns of amplitude modulation for older time periods is difficult at this time.

Zumaia/Sopelana terrestrial composite records, as generated by \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

Here we aim to use the best available records older than the K/T boundary to constrain which astronomical solution best reflects this time period.


\section{Material and Methods}\label{sec:mm}

\textbf{TODO:} Decide on consistent naming for scaled vs.\ normalized: subtract mean, divide by standard deviation. I like scaled?

\subsection{Datasets Used}\label{sec:data}

Site descriptions for Zumaia and Sopelana.
We use proxy records \gls{MS}, \gls{d13C}, and \gls{L*} measurements~\cite{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

\subsection{Age Model}\label{sec:agemodel}

The age model for the Zumaia and Sopelana sites is based on the identification of \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima in the field \citeA{Batenburg2012,Batenburg2014}.

\subsection{Removing Long-Term Trends}\label{sec:detrend}

We removed long-term trends in the record using various strategies because there are some significant shifts in the lithology (red, clay-rich intervals and whiter marl-rich intervals) that could hamper spectral analysis and filtering.
Below is an overview of several of the strategies employed to remove these long-term non-cyclic trends.

We limit the effect these trends can have on our results by applying bandpass filtering only in the time-domain, after applying the age model from the field (\cref{sec:algorithm}).

\textbf{TODO:} I'll remove the ones we think are stupid after, and revise this table into a simple paragraph. For now this summarizes what I've looked at!

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab:detrend_types}The different methods to remove long-term trends.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  name & method\\
  \hline
  \texttt{value} & The raw value. Most spectral analysis/bandpass filtering remove a single linear trend.\\
  \texttt{scl} & The scaled raw value (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation). \\
  \texttt{lin\_scl\_rw} & Remove linear trends from red/white intervals separately, then scale the result.\\ % I think I chose wrong intervals for this so have removed it.
  \texttt{lin\_scl\_coarse} & Chop the record into three (33--59 m) sections and detrend linearly.\\
  \texttt{lin\_scl\_fine} & Chop the record into smaller (\appr\qtyrange{9}{21}{\metre}) sections and detrend linearly.\\
  \texttt{gam\_scl} & Subtract a \gls{GAM} from the value, then scale the result.\\
  \texttt{lin\_gam\_scl} & First do \texttt{lin\_scl} from above, then do \texttt{gam\_det}.\\ % This is excessive so I removed it from the analysis.
  \texttt{lp\_scl} & Subtract a lowpass filter from the value, then scale the result.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Spectral Analysis and Filtering}\label{sec:spectral}

We perform spectral analysis to verify the presence of Milankovitch cycles in the proxy records.

We compute and show the \gls{FFT}, % Blackman-Tukey (BT), % Lomb-Scargle (LS),
\gls{MTM}, and the \gls{MTLS} to illustrate the sensitivity of the spectral analysis to the analysis tool used.

We use bandpass filtering to extract the \qtylist{405;100}{\kiloyear} cycles (rectangular windows targeting frequencies of \qtylist{0.00247;0.00909}{cycles\per\kilo\year}\textpm\qty{30}{\percent}, zero-padded with twice the number of datapoints).


\subsection{Finding the Best Fit}\label{sec:algorithm}

In order to test which astronomical solution best matches the data, we adopt and extend the approach of \citeA{ZeebeLourens2019,ZeebeLourens2022EPSL}.
We started with the detrended data (see \cref{sec:detrend}) and the depths of the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima as identified in the field (\cref{sec:agemodel}), which we matched to the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} filtered minima for each astronomical solution.
We then applied these agemodels and performed bandpass filtering targeting the \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} cycles in the time domain.
We added the filtered signals and scaled (or normalized: subtracted the mean and divided
by the standard deviation) the result to construct an artificial ``eccentricity'' curve.
To study the effect of the two cycles on the match with the astronomical solution, we also looked at the effect of assigning different weights to the two filtered signals (weights of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:0.75, 1:1, 0.75:1, 0.5:1, 0.25:1, and 0:1 for the \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} cycles respectively).
The scaled astronomical solutions were then interpolated to the same timesteps as the data, and the squared differences were summarized by calculating the \gls{RMSD}.

In order to optimize the tiepoints---the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima depths as identified in the field (see \cref{sec:agemodel})---we iteratively shifted each tiepoint from the youngest to oldest by a range of values between \qtyrange[range-phrase=~to~]{-1.6}{1.6}{\metre} in \qty{20}{\centi\metre} increments (about \qty{10}{\percent} of the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} period).
After tweaking the tiepoint depth the altered agemodel is applied, the record is filtered for the \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} cycles, and an artificial eccentricity curve was created to calculate the \gls{RMSD} as before.
Once the optimal (lowest \gls{RMSD}) tiepoint depth was found, we fixed it and moved on to the next-youngest tiepoint to find the overall best fit.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item apply the agemodel from the field to the detrended record
% \item for the youngest 405 kyr tiepoint
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item for each tiepoint depth error
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item apply the new age model to the record
%     \item apply a 405 and 100 kyr filter in the time domain
%     \item compute ``eccentricity'' construct by combining the normalized
%       filters
%     \item interpolate astronomical solution to the record's timesteps
%     \item calculate the squared difference between our construct and the
%       astronomical solution for each timestep
%     \item for the entire solution, calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD).
%     \end{enumerate}
%   \item filter out the lowest RMSD score, get the best tie\_error for this 405
%     kyr minimum
%   \end{enumerate}
% \item move on to next youngest 405 kyr minimum and repeat from step 2.
% \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{\gls{RMSD} of different astronomical solutions versus the Zumaia and Sopelana Maastrichtian records} for \gls{d13C}, \gls{L*}, and \gls{MS}.
  Here we show a 1:1 combination of the \qtylist{405;110}{\kiloyear} filtered proxy records (see \cref{fig:rolling-rmsd-improvement} for different combinations).
  Circles show results of applying the age model from the field, while upside-down     triangles show the improved results after iteratively shifting the \qty{405}{\kiloyear} minima tiepoints by small increments up to \textpm\qty{1.6}{\metre} (see text) and calculating the \gls{RMSD} for the whole record at each iteration to decide which tiepoint error gives the best fit (see \cref{sec:algorithm}).
  Colours for Zumaia's \gls{L*} record show different detrending methods (\cref{tab:detrend_types})}

  \textbf{Maastrichtian Zumaia and Sopelana filtered/normalized \gls{L*} records tuned to different astronomical solutions.}
  The bottom log is adapted from \citeA{Batenburg2014}.
  This uses short linear detrending to correct for changes in sediment composition (\cref{sec:detrend}).
  We perform the analysis separately for Zumaia values above and below \qty{109.26}{\metre} (the transition between the red/white intervals) to account for a large change in the sedimentation rate.
  The depth figure shows the Zumaia filtered record if we combine everything using the same filter.
  Numbers, opacity, and line thickness indicate \gls{RMSD} scores after optimizing the tiepoints (see \cref{sec:algorithm}).}
\end{figure}



\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}


Why do we prefer the \gls{L*} proxy over \gls{MS} and \gls{d13C}?

The \gls{d13C} proxy captures lower frequency orbital forcing more strongly~\cite{Zeebe2017,Kocken2019loscar}.
For \gls{MS} it is unclear how it relates to the climate forcing. %Richard doesn't trust/understand it.
\gls{L*} often corresponds more to likely corresponds to changes in the lithology that have been driven by carbonate--clay alternations, which are in turn driven by changes in wetness and climate.
We argue that the colour reflectance record most directly reflects the orbital forcing.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

% Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
%  will not be numbered, e.g.,:
%  \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

%  Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
%  be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
%  \begin{equation}
%  x^2=y^2 + z^2
%  \end{equation}


% % To create multiline equations, use the
% % \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% % as demonstrated below.
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
%   y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
%         && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
% \end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
